    <h1>pre-work Phase 1</h1>
    <p>Git is version control software on your computer.</p>
    <p>we COMMIT our code version to git on our computer.</p>
    <p>Github.com is a cloud service that works with git to help us collaborate and share our code with others.</p>
    <p>we PUSH our code to GitHub.com.</p>
    <p>we DEPLOY our project to a server so that the world can view them in a browser on a computer, tablet or phone.</p>
    <p>In the bootcamp we DEPLOY to the bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu server</p>
    <h2>DEPLOY and PUSH are DIFFERENT!!!</h2>
